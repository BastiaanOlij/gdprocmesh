Todo list:
 - add better menu for adding new nodes, maybe radial menu?
 - add add node for real
 - add subtract node for real
 - add subdivide node
 - add sphere node
 - make generate normals work on a surface, have it calculate tangents and options like smooth?
 - add a UV unwrap (maybe using the Thekla module in Godot?)
 - add an input where we use another mesh as an input
 - add an extract node that takes a surface as input and has each array as an output
 - add boolean node to do CSG merge
 - add group node where you can combine a number of nodes into one new node to simplify graphs
